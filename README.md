# STONE-PAPER-SCISSORS
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game where two players simultaneously form one of three shapes: a closed fist (rock), a flat open hand (paper), or two extended fingers (scissors). Rock smashes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock, with the winner determined by these rules.
